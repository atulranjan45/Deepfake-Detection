# Model Creation
  - You will be able to preprocess the dataset, train a pytorch model of your own, predict on new unseen data using your model.
  
### Note: We Recommend using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)  for running the above code.
 ## Libraries
  - dlib
  - cv2
  - os
  - re
  - PIL
  - tensorflow 
  - numpy 
  - matplotlib 
  - seaborn 
  - pandas 
  - scikit-learn

 ## Dataset 
  - [Celeb-DF](https://github.com/yuezunli/celeb-deepfakeforensics)
 ## Drive link: 
    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F5P5T2Z_vcYPPrmcWx5cCKoJH-TvCLkL?usp=sharing

 ## Preprocessing
  - Load the dataset
  - Split the video into frames
  - crop the face from each frame
  - save the face cropped video

 ## Model and train
  - Create a DeepCNN model.
  - Split the data into train and test data
  - Train the model
  - Test the model
  - save the model in .h5 file

 ## Predict 
  - Load the saved .h5 model
  - Predict the output based in trained weights.


  - Trained Models
    - You can just download our [trained models](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c4SJ9aFFNXNXrLoNCYSf5OAwnO7loQpu/view?usp=sharing) and run the predict file for prediction.
